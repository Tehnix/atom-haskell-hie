# [Not Yet Ready!] Atom plugin for HIE LSP server

This is still very early development. So far `hie` has been spawned, but no actions are available yet in the editor even though consumers and providers have been set.

Uses [atom-languageclient](https://github.com/atom/atom-languageclient) for the LSP client, and [HIE](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine) as the LSP server.
